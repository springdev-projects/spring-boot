{% capture billboard_description %}
Takes an opinionated view of building production-ready Spring applications. Spring Boot favors convention over configuration and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## 特性

* Create stand-alone Spring applications 
* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
* Provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration
* Automatically configure Spring whenever possible
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
* Absolutely <strong>no code generation</strong> and <strong>no requirement for XML</strong> configuration

The [reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle) includes detailed descriptions of all the features, plus an extensive [howto](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#howto) for common use cases.

## 快速上手

If you are Java developer you can use [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a basic project, follow the "Quick Start" example below, or read the reference documentation [getting started](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started) guide.

`hello/SampleController.java`

```java
package hello;

import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import org.springframework.stereotype.*;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@Controller
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SampleController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    @ResponseBody
    String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SpringApplication.run(SampleController.class, args);
    }
}
```

## Spring Boot CLI

Spring Boot ships with a command line tool that can be used if you want to quickly prototype with Spring. It allows you to run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax, without so much boilerplate code. Follow the instructions in our main documentation if you want to [install the Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli).
